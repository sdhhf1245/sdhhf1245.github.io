## what is bites?

so bites is a bot i made last month.  
it's a discord gambling bot that currently includes games like mines, plinko, blackjack, slots, and crash. all the games are built from scratch and run through slash commands.

i built the whole thing in javascript, using discord.js. it took me about a week to get it functional, and even though it's technically "done", i'm stilllllllllll working on improving it. it's kind of in beta right now. i've kept it private for testing, but i'm planning to make it public soon.

## the games

### mines

the mines game is inspired by the stake's gamemode.

### baltop

  alt="ss"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

baltop is the balance leaderboard which is a quick way to see who's winning (or losing) the most. it's updated live based on user data stored in a sqlite db.

### slots

<Image

  alt="ss"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

the slots game is built with purely Math.random. it's a simple gamemode

## what's next?

next steps? i want to make the embeds stylish, fix a few bugs, and add some QoL features like daily streaks, better balance tracking, and maybe even a new gamemode
